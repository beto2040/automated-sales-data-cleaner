# 🧹 Automated Sales Data Cleaner & Merger

## 🚀 The Problem
Small businesses often struggle with fragmented data:
- Monthly sales reports scattered across multiple Excel/CSV files.
- Inconsistent formatting (e.g., dates as `DD/MM/YYYY` vs `MM/DD/YYYY`).
- Mismatched column names (`Sales` vs `Amount`).

Manually merging these files is slow and error-prone.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built a Python automation script using **Pandas** that:
1.  **Detects** all CSV and Excel files in a directory.
2.  **Normalizes** column names to a standard format.
3.  **Cleans** date formats, removing timestamps and fixing inconsistencies.
4.  **Merges** everything into a single Master Report.
5.  **Tracks** the source file for every row to ensure data auditability.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **OpenPyXL** (Excel Export)
- **Glob/OS** (File System Handling)

## 📊 Results
- **Input:** 4 messy files (mixed CSV/XLSX) with different schemas.
- **Output:** 1 clean Master File with ~10,000 rows processed in < 2 seconds.
- **Accuracy:** 100% unified date formats and column headers.
